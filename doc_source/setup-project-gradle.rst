Using the SDK with Gradle
#########################

To use the |sdk-java| in your Gradle_ project, use Spring's `dependency management plugin
<https://github.com/spring-gradle-plugins/dependency-management-plugin>`_ for Gradle, which can be
used to import the SDK's Maven Bill of Materials (BOM) to manage SDK dependencies for your project.

.. topic:: To configure the SDK for Gradle

    #. Add the dependency management plugin to your :file:`build.gradle` file

       .. code-block:: groovy

          buildscript {
              repositories {
                  mavenCentral()
              }
              dependencies {
                  classpath "io.spring.gradle:dependency-management-plugin:1.0.0.RC2"
              }
          }

          apply plugin: "io.spring.dependency-management"

    #. Add the BOM to the *dependencyManagement* section of the file

       .. code-block:: groovy

          dependencyManagement {
              imports {
                  mavenBom 'com.amazonaws:aws-java-sdk-bom:1.10.77'
              }
          }

    #. Specify the SDK modules that you'll be using in the *dependencies* section

       .. code-block:: groovy

          dependencies {
              compile 'com.amazonaws:aws-java-sdk-s3'
              testCompile group: 'junit', name: 'junit', version: '4.11'
          }

Gradle will automatically resolve the correct version of your SDK dependencies using the information
from the BOM.

.. note:: For more detail about specifying SDK dependencies using the BOM, see
   :doc:`setup-project-maven`.
